	================ STEAMWORKS SDK license ===================
	VALVE, Corp.
	SDK LICENSE

	This SDK License (the "Agreement") is made by and between you (the "Licensee")
	and Valve Corporation, a Washington corporation,(‚ÄúValve‚Äù) with offices located
	at 10400 NE 4th Street, Suite 1400, Bellevue, WA 98004, USA.

	THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES A CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND VALVE. PLEASE READ IT BEFORE
	DOWNLOADING OR USING THE STEAMWORKS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (THE ‚ÄúSDK‚Äù).
	BY DOWNLOADING AND/OR USING THE SDK YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
	IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND/OR USE THE SDK.

	Whereas, Valve is the developer of an online platform titled "Steam" that provides
	online distribution services as well as a number of additional online services designed
	to be embedded in computer games and application software, including, but not limited to,
	user authentication, in-app purchasing and trading, leaderboards, matchmaking,
	stats and achievements (the ‚ÄúSteamworks Services‚Äù) and the SDK;

	Whereas, Licensee wishes to develop a game or application software designed to
	take advantage of the Steamworks Services (the "Licensee Software"); and

	Whereas, Licensee wishes to receive, and Valve wishes to disclose to Licensee,
	the SDK, and other information as deemed appropriate by Valve, all on the terms
	set forth herein;

	Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises made herein, the parties
	agree as follows:

	1. License.

	1.1 License Grant. Valve hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free,
	terminable, worldwide, nontransferable license to:

	(a) use and locally reproduce the SDK in source code form, solely to develop
	the Licensee Software; and

	(b) reproduce and distribute the part of the SDK provided inside the folder
	named redistributable_bin (the "SDK Redistributables") along with the Licensee
	Software in object code form.

	1.2 Updates. Valve may from time to time, in its sole discretion, provide updates,
	error corrections, and future versions of the SDK to Licensee. Upon delivery,
	such updates, error corrections and future versions shall be deemed part of the SDK,
	as applicable, under this Agreement.

	1.3 Reservation of Rights. Valve reserves all rights not explicitly granted herein.

	2. Ancillary Obligations.

	2.1 No obligation to provide services. Nothing herein shall be construed as establishing
	an obligation to Valve to provide Steamworks Services or accept Licensee Software
	for distribution via Steam.

	2.2 Indemnity. Licensee hereby agrees that it is solely responsible for any and all
	Licensee Software and Licensee's creation, distribution, and promotion thereof.
	Licensee shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Valve, its officers, directors,
	employees and agents against any and all claims, damages (including reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees and costs),
	losses, or liabilities whatsoever arising out of Licensee's creation, distribution,
	or promotion of the Licensee Software.

	2.3 Trademarks. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not grant
	Licensee any right to use any trademarks or trade names of Valve or its licensors.
	All such marks shall remain the property of the respective owner. Licensee will
	refrain from any action or communication that can be incorrectly interpreted
	as a cooperation or partnership between Valve and Licensee.

	2.4 No reverse engineering. Licensee will not take any steps to reverse engineer the
	functionality of the SDK or develop software to replace the SDK's functionality.
	If Licensee develops software to interact with the Steamworks Services, such software
	shall not communicate with the Steamworks Services directly but always through the
	application programming interface (API) provided by the SDK Redistributables.

	3. Term.

	3.1 Term. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date Licensee downloads or
	installs the SDK. It will continue to apply until terminated by either Valve or
	Licensee as set out below.

	3.2 Termination. Valve may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written
	(including email) notice to Licensee. Licensee may terminate this Agreement at
	any time by ceasing Licensees use of the SDK and ending Licensee's distribution
	of Licensee Software created using the SDK. Furthermore, the Agreement will
	terminate automatically upon Licensee's breach of any term of this Agreement.

	3.3 Survival. Sections 1.3, 2, 3.2, 3.3, and 4-6 shall survive any expiration
	or termination of this Agreement.

	4. Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability

	4.1 NO WARRANTIES. THE SDK AND ANY OTHER MATERIAL DOWNLOADED BY LICENSEE
	IS PROVIDED ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù. VALVE AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SDK,
	EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
	NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

	4.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL VALVE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
	INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,
	OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE ENGINE AND/OR THE SDK,
	EVEN IF VALVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	5. No Exclusivity.

	Neither this Agreement nor the disclosure or receipt of Information shall constitute
	or imply any promise to or intention to make any purchase of products or services by
	either party or its affiliated companies or any commitment by either party or its
	affiliated companies with respect to the present or future marketing of any product
	or service or any commitment to enter into any other business relationship.
	Except for the license and use restrictions expressly set forth herein,
	each party will be free (1) to pursue, negotiate, and enter into similar relationships
	with third parties and (2) to develop, market, and make available similar products and services.
	Neither party will be obligated to enter into any other agreement with the other
	party by virtue of this Agreement.

	6. General.

	6.1 Modification. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid
	or binding on the parties unless made in writing and signed on behalf of both
	of the parties by their respective duly authorized officers or representatives.

	6.2 Assignment. Licensee may not assign this agreement without the prior written consent of Valve.
	Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement will inure
	to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties, their successors and assigns.

	6.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of
	competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable,
	the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

	6.4 Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by the
	laws of the State of Washington. For any claims of any kind arising out of this
	Agreement or use of the SDK, each of the parties hereto submits to exclusive
	jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts sitting in King County, Washington.

	6.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between
	the parties hereto and supersedes all previous communications, representations
	and understandings, oral or written, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
