	================ STEAMWORKS SDK license ===================
	VALVE, Corp.
	SDK LICENSE

	This SDK License (the "Agreement") is made by and between you (the "Licensee")
	and Valve Corporation, a Washington corporation,(“Valve”) with offices located
	at 10400 NE 4th Street, Suite 1400, Bellevue, WA 98004, USA.

	THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES A CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND VALVE. PLEASE READ IT BEFORE
	DOWNLOADING OR USING THE STEAMWORKS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (THE “SDK”).
	BY DOWNLOADING AND/OR USING THE SDK YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
	IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND/OR USE THE SDK.

	Whereas, Valve is the developer of an online platform titled "Steam" that provides
	online distribution services as well as a number of additional online services designed
	to be embedded in computer games and application software, including, but not limited to,
	user authentication, in-app purchasing and trading, leaderboards, matchmaking,
	stats and achievements (the “Steamworks Services”) and the SDK;

	Whereas, Licensee wishes to develop a game or application software designed to
	take advantage of the Steamworks Services (the "Licensee Software"); and

	Whereas, Licensee wishes to receive, and Valve wishes to disclose to Licensee,
	the SDK, and other information as deemed appropriate by Valve, all on the terms
	set forth herein;

	Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises made herein, the parties
	agree as follows:

	1. License.

	1.1 License Grant. Valve hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free,
	terminable, worldwide, nontransferable license to:

	(a) use and locally reproduce the SDK in source code form, solely to develop
	the Licensee Software; and

	(b) reproduce and distribute the part of the SDK provided inside the folder
	named redistributable_bin (the "SDK Redistributables") along with the Licensee
	Software in object code form.

	1.2 Updates. Valve may from time to time, in its sole discretion, provide updates,
	error corrections, and future versions of the SDK to Licensee. Upon delivery,
	such updates, error corrections and future versions shall be deemed part of the SDK,
	as applicable, under this Agreement.

	1.3 Reservation of Rights. Valve reserves all rights not explicitly granted herein.

	2. Ancillary Obligations.

	2.1 No obligation to provide services. Nothing herein shall be construed as establishing
	an obligation to Valve to provide Steamworks Services or accept Licensee Software
	for distribution via Steam.

	2.2 Indemnity. Licensee hereby agrees that it is solely responsible for any and all
	Licensee Software and Licensee's creation, distribution, and promotion thereof.
	Licensee shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Valve, its officers, directors,
	employees and agents against any and all claims, damages (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs),
	losses, or liabilities whatsoever arising out of Licensee's creation, distribution,
	or promotion of the Licensee Software.

	2.3 Trademarks. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not grant
	Licensee any right to use any trademarks or trade names of Valve or its licensors.
	All such marks shall remain the property of the respective owner. Licensee will
	refrain from any action or communication that can be incorrectly interpreted
	as a cooperation or partnership between Valve and Licensee.

	2.4 No reverse engineering. Licensee will not take any steps to reverse engineer the
	functionality of the SDK or develop software to replace the SDK's functionality.
	If Licensee develops software to interact with the Steamworks Services, such software
	shall not communicate with the Steamworks Services directly but always through the
	application programming interface (API) provided by the SDK Redistributables.

	3. Term.

	3.1 Term. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date Licensee downloads or
	installs the SDK. It will continue to apply until terminated by either Valve or
	Licensee as set out below.

	3.2 Termination. Valve may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written
	(including email) notice to Licensee. Licensee may terminate this Agreement at
	any time by ceasing Licensees use of the SDK and ending Licensee's distribution
	of Licensee Software created using the SDK. Furthermore, the Agreement will
	terminate automatically upon Licensee's breach of any term of this Agreement.

	3.3 Survival. Sections 1.3, 2, 3.2, 3.3, and 4-6 shall survive any expiration
	or termination of this Agreement.

	4. Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability

	4.1 NO WARRANTIES. THE SDK AND ANY OTHER MATERIAL DOWNLOADED BY LICENSEE
	IS PROVIDED “AS IS”. VALVE AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SDK,
	EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
	NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

	4.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL VALVE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
	INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,
	OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE ENGINE AND/OR THE SDK,
	EVEN IF VALVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	5. No Exclusivity.

	Neither this Agreement nor the disclosure or receipt of Information shall constitute
	or imply any promise to or intention to make any purchase of products or services by
	either party or its affiliated companies or any commitment by either party or its
	affiliated companies with respect to the present or future marketing of any product
	or service or any commitment to enter into any other business relationship.
	Except for the license and use restrictions expressly set forth herein,
	each party will be free (1) to pursue, negotiate, and enter into similar relationships
	with third parties and (2) to develop, market, and make available similar products and services.
	Neither party will be obligated to enter into any other agreement with the other
	party by virtue of this Agreement.

	6. General.

	6.1 Modification. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid
	or binding on the parties unless made in writing and signed on behalf of both
	of the parties by their respective duly authorized officers or representatives.

	6.2 Assignment. Licensee may not assign this agreement without the prior written consent of Valve.
	Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement will inure
	to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties, their successors and assigns.

	6.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of
	competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable,
	the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

	6.4 Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by the
	laws of the State of Washington. For any claims of any kind arising out of this
	Agreement or use of the SDK, each of the parties hereto submits to exclusive
	jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts sitting in King County, Washington.

	6.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between
	the parties hereto and supersedes all previous communications, representations
	and understandings, oral or written, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

				GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
					Version 3, 29 June 2007

	Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
	Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


	This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
	the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
	License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

	0. Additional Definitions.

	As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
	General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
	General Public License.

	"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
	other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

	An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
	by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
	Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
	of using an interface provided by the Library.

	A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
	Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
	with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
	Version".

	The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
	Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
	for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
	based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

	The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
	object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
	and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
	Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

	1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

	You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
	without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

	2. Conveying Modified Versions.

	If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
	facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
	that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
	facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
	version:

	a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
	ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
	function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
	whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

	b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
	this License applicable to that copy.

	3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

	The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
	a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
	code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
	material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
	layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
	(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

	a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
	Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
	covered by this License.

	b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
	document.

	4. Combined Works.

	You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
	taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
	portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
	engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
	the following:

	a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
	the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
	covered by this License.

	b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
	document.

	c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
	execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
	these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
	copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

	d) Do one of the following:

		0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
		License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
		suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
		recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
		the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
		manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
		Corresponding Source.

		1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
		Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
		a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
		system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
		of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
		Version.

	e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
	be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
	GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
	necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
	Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
	Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
	you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
	the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
	Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
	Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
	for conveying Corresponding Source.)

	5. Combined Libraries.

	You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
	Library side by side in a single library together with other library
	facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
	License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
	choice, if you do both of the following:

	a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
	on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
	conveyed under the terms of this License.

	b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
	is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
	accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

	6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

	The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
	of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
	versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
	differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

	Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
	Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
	of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
	applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
	conditions either of that published version or of any later version
	published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
	received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
	General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
	General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

	If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
	whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
	apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
	permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
	Library.
